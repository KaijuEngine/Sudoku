# Sudoku
This is the port of my Sudoku game. I originally created the game directly using the Kaiju engine source, this project is the version developed within the Kaiju editor. You can follow along with the tutorials that show the development of this project [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmjX_M6lEZE&list=PLm1w78-UUlMJ0IfIuE6fMQLezaiPQJjWU&index=1)
